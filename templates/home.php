                    Every day someone blazes a new trail to fame and fortune, but Dr.
                    Rawas offers something much more valuable: an empowering outlook
                    that leads not only to career advancement and personal success, but
                    also to the infinite satisfaction of jobs well-done and lives well-lived,
                    to the unparalleled experience of fulfillment. The same perspective transforms
                    offices and other workplaces, too, enhancing cooperation and improving bottom-line results.

                    <br />
                    Ambition can be a powerful force driving people from all walks of
                    life to get ahead. It makes them study harder, work longer, and think bigger, all of which are good things.

                    But ambition can consume, not just create, and whatever they accomplish,
                    many ambitious people struggle to obtain personal fulfillment. A prominent
                    feature of leadership excellence, then, is to maintain a balance among the
                    various facets of one’s life.
