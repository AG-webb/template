                                Even before completing his PhD, Dr. Rawas had worked for several years at the Omani
                                Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals, serving as Personal Assistant to the Minister.
                                As his formal studies came to a close, he returned to his homeland determined to help
                                it navigate the challenges of comprehensive modernization.

                                and their implications soon attracted him to new opportunities in sectors across the economy.
                                Thus began a remarkable journey that has made Dr. Rawas one of Oman’s most respected business
                                figures, a can-do leader, speaker, coach, and consultant who gets transformational things done
                                by bringing out the best in those around him.

                    It is from empowering others to evolve, though, that Dr. Rawas gains the most
                    satisfaction. His executive coaching inspires young business people to make the
                    most of their leadership potential by building their emotional intelligence; his
                    public speaking – in English or Arabic – inspires audiences to embrace change as
                    an ally; his seat on the Board of the Middle East Leadership Academy helps nurture
                    the next generation of regional business leaders; and his guidance magnified the
                    impacts of a flagship UNICEF program to promote all manner of opportunity for youth in Oman and the region.

                commissioned by Omantel to document the “great legacy of unforgettable
                memories about countless contributions by Dr. Amer”. Fittingly, the volume consists
                of testimonials in which his former colleagues – from the most junior employees to
                the highest-ranking executives – describe the profound impacts he had on their

                    <div class="text">
                        Dr. Rawas teaches that empathy is the key to constructive human interactions,
                        especially when it comes to the sharing and absorption of new knowledge and
                        greater awareness. Whatever the capacity – leader, speaker, coach, or other –
                        the same rule applies: if you want to change minds, you have to touch hearts.
                        He also teaches that meaningful personal change is a process, not an event, and
                        making such changes requires lasting commitment. One of a coach’s most important
                        tasks, therefore, is to figure out what will resonate with individual coaches,
                        and that means caring enough to identify their core motivations and innermost concerns.

                        These are powerful forces, and leaving them unexamined and/or unexploited can lead to undue
                        stress, anxiety, and other distractions that weaken job performance, erode physical and mental
                        health, and/or undermine key elements of our personal lives. By contrast, harnessing them as
                        sources of motivation, both conscious and subconscious, helps maintain the commitment and the
                        emotional intelligence required for people to evolve toward fulfillment.

                    Happiness is a wondrous thing, but fulfillment is both less scarce more sustainable,
                    and pursuing it generates its own rewards along the way. These qualities not only
                    make it a more realistic objective, but also a more useful one that sustains our
                    evolution, and fosters a healthier and more productive outlook on our daily work
                    responsibilities, long-term career goals, and overall purpose in life.

                    It should come as no surprise, too, that while outward happiness can mask deep-seated
                    dissatisfaction, fulfilled people are happier by default.
